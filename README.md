# Multi-agent maze exploration simulator

This is a C++ simulator allows for a variety of multi-agent exploration systems to be simulated within a maze environment. The goal of this is to be able to evalute high-level exploration control schemes without considering low-level challenges of robotic systems such as localisation. Data from simulationss can be exported in json format for analysis purposes. Additionally, gifs of simulations can be created for easy viewing. Portions of this project was completed for my disseration at TU Dublin.
